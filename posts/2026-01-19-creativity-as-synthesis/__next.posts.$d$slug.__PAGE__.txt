This essay proposes a different lens. The central challenge is not generating options, but evaluating them early enough to steer outcomes responsibly. By coupling decision-making to evidence — even through approximate proxies such as carbon, cost, and spatial performance — AI can help shift practice from image-led persuasion to outcome-led design. The goal is not to constrain creativity, but to re-ground it in synthesis under real constraints."}],"\n",["$","h2",null,{"children":"From More Options to Better Decisions"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"AI adoption in architecture is no longer hypothetical, and the profession is right to treat it as a matter of when and how rather than if. Yet much of the current discussion still reduces AI to a productivity instrument for the early stages of design: more images, faster ideation, greater optioneering. This framing quietly codifies a shallow workflow — generate, select, rationalise — where aesthetic alignment is achieved early and the deeper work of resolution is deferred."}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"If the built environment demands anything from architects today, it is not the ability to produce more concepts, but the ability to deliver certainty: coordinated, accountable, high-performing outcomes under real constraints. The more urgent opportunity, then, is to apply AI not only where precision is low, but where precision is costly — using it to increase confidence, reduce rework, and make architectural decision-making more traceable, not merely faster. This tension becomes visible in a workflow that increasingly defines design as the production and curation of images, rather than the disciplined reduction of uncertainty. Recent industry commentary often frames AI adoption as an early-stage accelerator — a way to produce more images and options faster — while treating later-stage resolution as unchanged."}],"\n",["$","h2",null,{"children":"The Risky Logic of Generate–Select–Rationalise"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Generate–select–rationalise sounds efficient and, whether we are willing to accept it or not, aligns with how architectural design often happens in practice, but, if we look closely, it encodes a risky ordering of priorities.

What changes with contemporary AI is, on the one hand, the transfer of agency to generative systems, and on the other, the opportunity to make selection more accountable. If evaluation becomes part of the loop — even in approximate forms, such as carbon, cost, or spatial performance proxies — then curation can be guided by evidence rather than appearance alone. That shift increases certainty earlier, reduces rework, and creates a clearer pathway toward lower-impact, lower-cost delivery."}]

5:["$","p",null,{"children":"The alternative is not necessarily to change the workflow, but to change the methods through which alternatives are evaluated. That shift implies a broader change in paradigm. Image generation can remain part of early-stage design, but it should be supplemented by generative and evaluative tools that attend to determinants of the built environment beyond appearance: feasibility (from financial to technical), regulatory compliance, energy and carbon performance, material usage, and even supply constraints, among others."}]
6:["$","p",null,{"children":"I acknowledge that this complicates the process and appears to run against the speed and fluidity that image generation enables — and I suspect this is the crux of the current tension. AI opens an opportunity to bring these dimensions forward, making them present earlier rather than deferred into later-stage resolution. Yet doing so is not straightforward. This is where industrialised building principles become relevant. A platform approach, by defining the constraints within which a system can operate, makes multi-criteria evaluation more tractable. The cost, of course, is a perceived reduction in “creative freedom”, which can feel like a steep price for designers trained to understand their value primarily as aesthetic innovation."}]
7:["$","p",null,{"children":"Creative freedom is not the absence of constraints; it is the ability to produce meaningful difference within constraints that matter. Understood as a set of shared components, interfaces, and rules of assembly, a platform approach does not eliminate creativity — it re-couples it with the conditions that make architecture viable and valuable. It brings feasibility, compliance, performance, and environmental impact into the same frame as aesthetics, forcing trade-offs to surface early rather than being deferred into downstream correction. The question is not whether this is desirable in principle, but what it demands of practice in terms of methods, roles, and decision structures."}]

9:["$","p",null,{"children":"If the problem is not generating options but evaluating them early, then AI adoption should prioritise workflow understanding and articulation over chasing the latest tool. This raises a prior question that the profession rarely addresses directly: how can we formalise design workflows in a way that couples design decisions to evaluation, rather than separating form-making from verification?"}]
a:["$","p",null,{"children":"The difficulty, of course, is that architecture has historically guarded its methods as tacit, while evaluation demands explicit criteria. By understanding design as a sequence of commitments, it becomes possible to identify where uncertainty emerges — when material choices are made, when structural systems are locked in, when compliance pathways begin to constrain the search space. From there, targeted support can be developed to reduce uncertainty at the points where it matters most."}]
b:["$","p",null,{"children":"The aim is to treat creativity as synthesis from the outset: integrating feasibility, performance, and consequence into form-making, rather than repairing misalignments downstream. In this framing, platform development follows naturally — not as a constraint on design, but as the mechanism through which multi-criteria evaluation becomes manageable early enough to steer outcomes."}]
c:["$","p",null,{"children":"The most consequential work ahead may not be better models, but better ways of describing practice. If AI is to support judgement rather than accelerate output, workflows must become legible enough to couple decisions to evaluation early. That shift will not arrive through tooling alone; it demands new representations of design work, and new habits of accountability. The opportunity, then, is not to generate more options, but to build the conditions under which better decisions can be made earlier."}]
