This essay proposes a different lens. The central challenge is not generating options, but evaluating them early enough to steer outcomes responsibly. By coupling decision-making to evidence — even through approximate proxies such as carbon, cost, and spatial performance — AI can help shift practice from image-led persuasion to outcome-led design. The goal is not to constrain creativity, but to re-ground it in synthesis under real constraints."}],"\n",["$","h2",null,{"children":"From More Options to Better Decisions"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"AI adoption in architecture is no longer hypothetical, and the profession is right to treat it as a matter of when and how rather than if.

The more urgent opportunity, then, is to apply AI not only where precision is low, but where precision is costly — using it to increase confidence, reduce rework, and make architectural decision-making more traceable, not merely faster. This tension becomes visible in a workflow that increasingly defines design as the production and curation of images, rather than the disciplined reduction of uncertainty. Recent industry commentary often frames AI adoption as an early-stage accelerator — a way to produce more images and options faster — while treating later-stage resolution as unchanged."}],"\n",["$","h2",null,{"children":"The Risky Logic of Generate–Select–Rationalise"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Generate–select–rationalise sounds efficient and, whether we are willing to accept it or not, aligns with how architectural design often happens in practice, but, if we look closely, it encodes a risky ordering of priorities.

That shift implies a broader change in paradigm. Image generation can remain part of early-stage design, but it should be supplemented by generative and evaluative tools that attend to determinants of the built environment beyond appearance: feasibility (from financial to technical), regulatory compliance, energy and carbon performance, material usage, and even supply constraints, among others."}]
18:["$","p",null,{"children":"I acknowledge that this complicates the process and appears to run against the speed and fluidity that image generation enables — and I suspect this is the crux of the current tension. AI opens an opportunity to bring these dimensions forward, making them present earlier rather than deferred into later-stage resolution. Yet doing so is not straightforward. This is where industrialised building principles become relevant. A platform approach, by defining the constraints within which a system can operate, makes multi-criteria evaluation more tractable. The cost, of course, is a perceived reduction in “creative freedom”, which can feel like a steep price for designers trained to understand their value primarily as aesthetic innovation."}]

Understood as a set of shared components, interfaces, and rules of assembly, a platform approach does not eliminate creativity — it re-couples it with the conditions that make architecture viable and valuable. It brings feasibility, compliance, performance, and environmental impact into the same frame as aesthetics, forcing trade-offs to surface early rather than being deferred into downstream correction. The question is not whether this is desirable in principle, but what it demands of practice in terms of methods, roles, and decision structures."}]

1c:["$","p",null,{"children":"The difficulty, of course, is that architecture has historically guarded its methods as tacit, while evaluation demands explicit criteria. By understanding design as a sequence of commitments, it becomes possible to identify where uncertainty emerges — when material choices are made, when structural systems are locked in, when compliance pathways begin to constrain the search space. From there, targeted support can be developed to reduce uncertainty at the points where it matters most."}]
