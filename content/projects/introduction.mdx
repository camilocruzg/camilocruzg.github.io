## **Who Am I?**  
I wouldn't call myself a hardcore gamer, but I've enjoyed video games ever since I first laid hands on a Nintendo handheld back in the 80s. More than just entertainment, games have always fascinated me as interactive systems—complex, creative, and full of possibilities.  

For the past 15 years, I've been teaching myself to code. Initially, I used it for solving work-related problems, analyzing data, and exploring generative design. But deep down, I've always wanted to complete a creative project from start to finish—something that challenges both my technical and artistic sides. I believe making a video game is the perfect way to do that, so I'm finally taking the plunge and giving it my all.


## **The Idea Behind the Game**  
The lightbulb moment came when I saw my son playing dots and boxes with his uncle. It reminded me of the vector racing game I used to play with my dad and friends—simple yet full of strategic depth. I thought it could be an easy enough mechanic to implement in code.  

That was a couple of years ago. Naturally, I went to the internet, found a few examples, tried them out, had some fun, and then… left them there. The idea didn't feel strong enough on its own. But the desire to bring a project to life never faded.  

Over time, that simmering idea reignited. What if I expanded the core mechanics with power-ups, obstacles, and a backstory? What if I turned it into something bigger? That's when *Vector Shift* truly began.  

## **Following the Fastucci Legacy**  
In *Vector Shift*, you step into the shoes of an aspiring race car driver with a name that carries weight—Fastucci. As the grandchild of Vectra Fastucci, the only driver to ever claim racing's unofficial Triple Crown—Formula 1, World Rally Championship, and GT Racing—you have a legacy to uphold.  

Vectra's legend is etched into motorsports history. From sneaking into her father's garage as a child in Italy to conquering the world's most grueling racing disciplines, she proved that speed isn't just about going fast—it's about mastering every road, every surface, and every challenge. But her story isn't just about trophies; it's about the philosophy of racing itself.  

For you, the journey is just beginning. As you climb the ranks of competitive racing, you'll not only chase victory but also uncover the stories, rivalries, and secrets that shaped your family's legacy. Can you follow in Vectra's tire tracks and carve your own path to greatness?  

## **Why This Blog?**  
Game development is a long and challenging process, and I want to document every step of the journey. This blog serves three main purposes:  

- **Keeping a record of development progress** – A place to reflect on what's been built, what's working, and what still needs improvement.  
- **Testing new ideas** – Writing about game mechanics, design challenges, and solutions will help refine concepts and invite feedback.  
- **Maintaining momentum** – Publicly sharing my progress will help keep me accountable, define clear milestones, and push the project forward.  

My goal is to post weekly about different challenges and discoveries that emerge throughout development. Whether it's coding struggles, design breakthroughs, or unexpected inspirations, I want to share the real process—messy, exciting, and rewarding.
